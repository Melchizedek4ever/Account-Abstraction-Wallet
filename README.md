An Account Abstraction management system similar to Ethereum's ERC-4337 standard but implemented on Stacks.

Core Goals:
1. Smart contract wallets
: User accounts are smart contracts, not just key pairs.
2. Programmable authentication & recovery
: Support for social recovery, multi-sig, sessionkeys, etc.
3. Meta-transactions
: Allow relayers (bundlers) to sponsor transactions/gas for users.
4. Custom validation logic
: Each account can define its own transaction validation rules.
5. User-friendly onboarding
: Seedless login, social recovery, and gas abstraction.
